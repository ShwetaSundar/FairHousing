# Project Title and Link to Proposal

Project Title: Fair Housing | [Link to Proposal](https://github.com/cengelh1/FairHousing#readme)

## Team Member Roles

Overall, each team member will continue working on examining various variables that will further support our research inquiry and midterm/final assignments. This will involve the identification of data sources, further data exploration and analysis, and the production of various tables and map visualizations. To help put together the midterm and final project deliverables, we have given each team member a general area of focus/responsibility, beyond their current variables they have been exploring. 

- **Chase - ArcGIS/Python Lead**, will provide support on story maps, ArcGIS, and website work. Topics: discussion on racial/socioeconomic segregation, the location of housing vs jobs by neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and which neighborhoods have more housing/jobs, restrictive zoning in high opportunity areas and how this impacts AFFH and where housing is needed but not being produced due to exclusionary zoning. Variables include: employment, zoning, TCAC sub variables, race variables.
- **Victor - Editor Lead**, will work on editing, analysis and writing. Topics: where affordable housing should be built, especially in higher resource areas that have not done their fair share of housing production. Variables include: rent burden levels in Los Angeles city, location of LIHTC and low income housing units, TCAC opportunity areas/levels (which encompasses many variables), larger socioeconomic variables that support unequal access to high resource/high land value/cost areas.
- **Christine - All Around Project Support**, help with compiling our data analysis/writing. Topics: patterns of development, displacement, and gentrification in low vs high income neighborhoods, where there are large concentrations of renters, which calls for more renter/tenant protections outside of just housing production. Variables include: number of renter vs owner occupied housing units
- **Shweta - Presentation/Graphics Lead**, will work on finalizing the midterm/final presentations and assignments and supporting graphics. Topics: understanding housing production in high resource areas and the efficiency of existing housing policies, TOC and affordable housing overlay zones and how it plays out in high resource areas. Variables include: the number of housing units (existing and new), vacant publicly-owned lots in higher resource areas.

## Status Update

Overall, we have each conducted data exploration and analysis on various variables (with supporting charts and map visualizations). We need to focus on refining the research question and scope of the project, helping us to connect all the ideas and topics we have discussed and done research on so far for a more cohesive research inquiry. We will work on finalizing the variables we want to include in this project. The general mood of the team is that we have some interesting topics and variables that we believe will support our main research questions; the difficulties may lie with the actual coding and mapping visualizations themselves, ensuring that we can get the intended data visualizations we want that can convey our research analysis effectively.

## Data Update

We are still exploring other potential data sources, beyond the ones each group member have explored and worked on for their individual class assignments. Further refining and analysis is needed - for example, the compatibility of data vs geodata sources we have collected, the differing geographic scopes of all the data, and how strong the data can support our research.

- Chaseâ€™s Data:
  - [USC Neighborhood data](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/) for social change (compiles ACS, LODES, and other census data). 
  - [California Healthy Places index](https://www.healthyplacesindex.org/)
- Victor's Data:
  - HCD/TCAC Opportunity Area Maps
     - https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/opportunity.asp 
     - https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/opportunity/2022.asp 
  - Social Explorer (encompassing census tracts in LA County) - data in census tracts in LA County (FIPS code: 06037) on "Residents Paying More Than 30% or at least 50% of Income on Rents". Data Source: Social Explorer Tables: ACS 2021 (5-Year Estimates)(SE), ACS 2021 (5-Year Estimates), Social Explorer; U.S. Census Bureau
  - LIHTC Units in Service: The total number of units in service through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in the city of Los Angeles between 2010-2019. This data comes from the [USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change (NDSC)](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2021/06/low-income-housing-tax-credits-lihtc/). 
  - Geodata is from the [Los Angeles GeoHub](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/d6c55385a0e749519f238b77135eafac_0/explore?location=34.020320%2C-118.410084%2C11.02), showing the census tracts in the City of Los Angeles (based on 2010 population).
- Christine's Data:
  - Social Explorer renter-occupied and owner-occupied housing units (ACS 5-year estimates)
- Shweta's Data:
  - [TCAC maps](https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/opportunity/2023/final_2023_shapefile.zip)- used in prior assignments but will need to be trimmed to LA city boundary
  - [Number of housing units](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2021_5yr/R13290451) - Shewta has mapped the number of housing units in LA city, but needs to overlay it on the TCAC maps
  - Number of new permits in the last 5 years - needs to be searched

We are open to looking at other existing research and resources that align with our research question on fair housing. For example, our research may involve looking into the [Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing data and mapping resources](https://affh-data-resources-cahcd.hub.arcgis.com/search?tags=hub%20housing%20needs%20and%20displacement%20risks) that are available as this is connected with current job and resource distributions that reflect socio-spatial segregation and disparities. 

## Concerns

- **Major Concerns** - The overall breadth, scale, and scope of our research question needs to be refined, as we need to be realistic about the time and effort we should allocate for this class/project, and reasonable about what variables we have and should ultimately include. We need to conduct more coding to figure out which variables work and can support our research well, and we may encounter many challenges with data analysis/visualization.
- **Minor Concerns** - We are concerned with finding time to do this coding and data exploration/analysis, accounting for mistakes and attending office hours/asking questions in the class slack. The coding itself will present challenges as we will likely run into time setbacks, delays, and roadblocks while cleaning up the data and mapping.
