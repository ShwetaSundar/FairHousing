# Introduction to Research Question

Are patterns of housing development (i.e. where affordable housing and market rate housing get built and donâ€™t get built), helping to uphold racial and socioeconomic segregation in Los Angeles? A case of High Resource neighborhoods of Los Angeles. 
Our group plans to examine patterns of development, gentrification, community resources, and segregation. 

# Why This Issue Is Important to Our Group

Los Angeles has [maintained decades long patterns of racial and socioeconomic segregation](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-28/l-a-segregation-problems-unchanged-in-decades-study-shows), despite overall growth in diversity. To make matters worse, historically racist land use practices and urban policies have lead to jarring disparities in resource access, tree canopy, public health and more. Immense dearth in housing supply in some areas has lead to gentrification and displacement pressure in others, sometimes making investment in communities more challenging (e.g. green gentrification).  By understanding patterns of housing demand and development, we hope to better understand the mechanics of gentrification and inequality. 
# Geographic Scope

We have chosen the neighborhoods in the City of LA. The City of Los Angeles spans wide extremes in terms of income, resources, and housing production and affordability.

# Preliminary Data Sources

-TCAC opportunity maps (extract census tracts the align with LA neighborhoods):  The TCAC map is an opportunity mapping tool developed by the State Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC) and the Housing and Community Investment Development (HCID) to direct investment in certain locations based on their opportunity. The map identifies locations with high opportunity as High or Highest Resource, and areas with high poverty levels and segregation as High Segregation and Poverty based on economic, education and environmental indicators. I aim to use this map as a base layer of my spatial analysis, to understand the characteristics of high opportunity (Highest and High Resource) CPAs to support housing.
-Racial distribution in the City of Los Angeles: Spatial distribution of racial majorities across the City of Los Angeles based on census data
-USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change: Shows Housing distribution in Los Angeles 

# Scope of Intended Analysis

Showing current racial/socioeconomic distributions and how that is linked to current patterns of housing demand/development, affordable housing stock, gentrification/displacement, resource and amenities distribution - intended to show disparities/unequal distribution in maps

# Conclusion

We hope to gain better insight into geographic patterns of development across the city of Los Angeles, and the demographic characteristics of the places 
An understanding of where demand for housing is high and where its development is being held back. Additionally we hope to better grasp how much housing is being supplied in high opportunity areas, and what kinds.
